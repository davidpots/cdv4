Why choose to stay with them rather than a brand they've stayed with before? Look to specific services or details about your travel customers that help them stand out. Also don't be afraid to think outside the box when it comes to travel planning (think boarding pets, vehicle storage, packing tips, or guides to local areas). </div>

Breakfast is making a big comeback for many. Morning workouts, mediations, and yoga flows allow folks to start their day with less stress and more focus. Specialty coffee drinks made from an at-home coffee bar have found their place too. Do your health and wellness customers offer online meditations or yoga flows to tune into? Or maybe coffee shops offer a barista class or want to hear about the kinds of drinks folks have been trying to master at home. Think about how your customers can make morning routines that much more enjoyable for consumers. </div>

              <div class="tile-carousel-item--topic--description">Pride Month is celebrated every June in tribute to those involved in the Stonewall Riots and is a month-long celebration of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, non-binary, and questioning people to promote self-affirmation, dignity, community, and equality rights. Over time, several other queer identities have come to light and been embraced under the wider acronym of the LGBTQIA+ umbrella, and intersectional discussions of Pride that acknowledge queer identities regarding gender, race, disability, and more have been especially encouraged. Pride Month is celebrated in different cities with parades, festivals, and other events. With COVID-19 still being a worldwide concern, it's likely that many parades and events will be altered, cancelled, or held online.  See posting recommendations for guidelines. Only post celebratory Pride Month content if requested or if your customer has a clear focus/identity as a queer business. Since Pride Month can potentially be considered a political statement or stance on a social issue, be cautious with what and how you post. Additionally, we don't want to suggest Pride Month events may be happening at a business if COVID-19 is preventing them from fruition.
