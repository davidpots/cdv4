              <div class="tile-carousel-item--topic--description">Solid hardwood flooring typically comes in long planks, milled with tongues and grooves on opposite edges so that the boards interlock when installed. It is always nailed down to the subfloor, a process that requires some skill. Because it is solid wood, this flooring can be sanded down and refinished several times over its life. Engineered flooring looks like solid hardwood, but it's made of a thin layer of hardwood bonded over a premium-quality plywood layer for added stability. It is both less expensive and easier for DIYers to install than solid hardwood. Solid hardwood vs engineered hardwood is a great topic to engage audiences — especially those looking to renovate or flip a new home. </div>

              <div class="tile-carousel-item--topic--description">From late 2020 to mid 2021, real estate inventory has been incredibly low. As of November 2020, inventory has been down a whole 20%. In December, more that 70% of homes for sale were on the market for less than a month. Simply put, in some markets, there aren't enough houses to meet buyer demand. For buyers, low inventory means: moving faster, expanding the search geographically, and considering what things are "must haves" vs. "nice to haves." It's a great idea to get pre-approved ASAP and find less expensive homes in great neighborhoods in they can afford to upgrade over time. For sellers, this is better news: Low inventory means less selling competition.   <a href="https://www.ramseysolutions.com/real-estate/real-estate-trends">Learn more &raquo;</a></div>

This marked more than 100 straight months of consistent price gains. Encourage your audience to really know what they can afford. It could be time to post some budgeting tips for buyers, like: limiting their house payment to no more than a specified percentage of their take-home pay, saving up to make  a down payment, etc. Remember: Avoid specific numbers or percentages within content.

              <div class="tile-carousel-item--topic--description">Mortgage interest rates, the fees that lenders charge as a percentage of a loan amount, are the lowest they've been in decades (around 3%), and economists think that this trend should continue through 2021. For buyers, this can help with affordability, but they should be cautious as to not purchse a home they cannot afford. For sellers, this means that buyers might be motivated to purchase their properties sooner. </div>

With permanent remote work becoming more common, city-dwellers —freed from the daily tether of a commute to the office and looking for affordable space to shelter, work, learn, and live— are finding homing solutions outside of their typical urban communities. Even before the pandemic, homebuyers looking for affordability were drawn to these areas, too. This is a great trend to capitalize on if you have any Realtor clients who work in areas or communities that are adjacent to large, bustling urban sprawls.

              <div class="tile-carousel-item--topic--description">The asking price for a home is the amount of money that the seller wishes to receive for their property. Due to lower inventory and higher demand, nearly every home sold during the pandemic went into a multiple-offer situation. Thus, a majority of recent buyers have had to pay over the asking price for their new home purchases. This particularly impacted first-time home buyers and millenials, who tended to have lower budgets. <a href="https://www.realtor.com/news/trends/how-covid-19-pandemic-impacted-millennial-home-buyers/">Learn more &raquo;</a></div>

              <div class="tile-carousel-item--topic--description">Due to lower inventory and higher demand, many buyers have had to settle for properties that need more work or repairs than they had originally planned or budgeted for. According to a survey, 56% of millennials bought a home requiring minor or major renovations, although only 42.4% began their search with that intention. If your client has connections to contractors, remodelers, interior designers, etc -- highlight that!

A home's "curb appeal" is the first impression it gives to the outside world. It enhances the overall look and feel of a property, and it also stimulates interest and provides a return on investment. Think of all the things you see when you stand in front of a home -- the driveway, the door, the front yard, etc. In general, touching up or enhancing these things adds to curb appeal. You could even post gardening tips or wreath examples.  <a href="https://www.lifestorage.com/blog/moving/diy-curb-appeal-tips-increase-buyer-appeal/">Learn more &raquo;</a></div>

                    <p class="tile--description">In real estate vernacular, a fixer-upper is a property that will require repair, though it usually can be lived in or used as it is. They are popular with buyers who wish to raise the property's potential value to get a return on their investment (I.e. "flip the house") , or as a starter home for buyers on a budget. </p>

                  <div class="tile--expandedContent">
                    <p class="tile--description">We know that interest rates are the lowest they've been in a while, but how does a lender calculate what an interest rate might look like for an individual buyer? Here are some factors they might consider when making that decision: Credit score -- if a buyer's credit score is higher, their interest rate will likely be lower. Down payment -- if a client puts less than 20% down on a property purchase, the lender might require mortgage insurance, which requires a slightly higher interest rate. Loan term -- in general, shorter-term loans have lower interest rates and lower overall costs, but higher monthly payments. Interest rate type -- fixed interest rates are locked in, but adjustable rates fluctuate based on the market after an initial period. This means clients might qualify for a lower rate early on, but the rate could gradually increase. This topic is an educational content minefield. Feel free to pick and choose different aspects to draw attention to, and to teach your clients' audiences how they could potentially qualify for lower interest rates.</p>

They are a great way to show off pretty kitchenware, momentos, and decor. They also may help make small rooms, like kitchens, seem bigger.

                  <h3 class="tile--title">Foreclosure </h3>
                  <div class="tile--expandedContent">
                    <p class="tile--description">Foreclosure is the process of a lender seizing and selling a property to a new buyer when the owner fails to make their mortgage payments as agreed. It enables the lender to recover at least some of the mortgage balance that is left. In some states, there must be a legal process in court before the home can be taken. Other states offer options that don't require a court to get involved. They also might be priced to sell quickly because of the lender’s need to recoup their losses.</p>
