People are looking to save money on monthly payments by any means possible. However, the mortgage rate on these types of loans reset after a set amount of years -- usually five or ten. If rates go down by that time, that's a good thing for the buyer. However, if rates go up, their monthly payments will increase to reflect the market at that time. Since mortgage rates are historically low right now, making this choice could saddle buyers with higher payments in the future. It's a risk, but it's one that could pay off if the buyer intends to sell their home after the initial period elapses.

The foyer, hallway, and main connectors should ass be the same color. 2) Think about sightlines. This term refers to the walls in other rooms you may see while standing in one room.

A simple way to avoid clashing color schemes is to stick to the same color-temperature family -- warms or cools, but not both. 4) Restrict edgier colors to closed-off rooms. Rooms that are out of the sightline of other spaces are a good place to go wild with color, if you're so inclined. Think Master bedrooms, kids rooms, powder rooms, etc. 5) Emphasize with accessories.

Instead of unpacking a little here and there, it'll feel much better to have one room fully unpacked than a few that are partially done. Pack essentials like bedding, toiletries, and medications in ways that are easily accessible. 2) Keep purging as you unpack. Presumably, you got rid of unwanted or unnecessary items while you packed. However, while you're unpacking, be ruthless. Set aside a box to collect extraneous belongings for donation while you are in the unpacking process.  3) Use lists! It's likely that things will be arranged differently in your new home than your last one. Tape lists of their contents outside of each drawer or cabinet until you become familiarized with what's inside.   ">Congrats! You've found a new home.

It's likely that things will be arranged differently in your new home than your last one. Tape lists of their contents outside of each drawer or cabinet until you become familiarized with what's inside.   </div>

                  <div class="tile--expandedContent">
                    <p class="tile--description">We know that interest rates are the lowest they've been in a while, but how does a lender calculate what an interest rate might look like for an individual buyer? Here are some factors they might consider when making that decision: Credit score -- if a buyer's credit score is higher, their interest rate will likely be lower. Down payment -- if a client puts less than 20% down on a property purchase, the lender might require mortgage insurance, which requires a slightly higher interest rate. Loan term -- in general, shorter-term loans have lower interest rates and lower overall costs, but higher monthly payments. Interest rate type -- fixed interest rates are locked in, but adjustable rates fluctuate based on the market after an initial period. This means clients might qualify for a lower rate early on, but the rate could gradually increase. This topic is an educational content minefield. Feel free to pick and choose different aspects to draw attention to, and to teach your clients' audiences how they could potentially qualify for lower interest rates. <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CPBqyUVhzUs/">Learn more &raquo;</a></p>

                  <div class="tile--expandedContent">
                    <p class="tile--description">Foreclosure is the process of a lender seizing and selling a property to a new buyer when the owner fails to make their mortgage payments as agreed. It enables the lender to recover at least some of the mortgage balance that is left. In some states, there must be a legal process in court before the home can be taken. Other states offer options that don't require a court to get involved. They also might be priced to sell quickly because of the lender’s need to recoup their losses. <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-a-foreclosure-1798185">Learn more &raquo;</a></p>

                    <p class="tile--description">Buying a house "sight unseen" means closing on it without ever having seen the home in person. The buyer has probably researched the surrounding neighborhood and schools and viewed the home online, but they haven't taken an in-person tour of the property. We've seen an uptick in this since the coronavirus pandemic -- social distancing concerns and low home inventory have caused buyers to consider this method and act quickly. To reduce risk and improve the virtual buying experience, experts suggest getting prequalified, taking a virtual tour of the home, doing homework on the area and property, and shopping around for the best rates.  </p>
