It's a risk, but it's one that could pay off if the buyer intends to sell their home after the initial period elapses. ">Due to record-high home prices, more buyers than ever are choosing to go with adjustable-rate mortgages, which offer lower monthly payments initially. People are looking to save money on monthly payments by any means possible. However, the mortgage rate on these types of loans reset after a set amount of years -- usually five or ten. If rates go down by that time, that's a good thing for the buyer. However, if rates go up, their monthly payments will increase to reflect the market at that time. Since mortgage rates are historically low right now, making this choice could saddle buyers with higher payments in the future. It's a risk, but it's one that could pay off if the buyer intends to sell their home after the initial period elapses. </div>

A simple way to avoid clashing color schemes is to stick to the same color-temperature family -- warms or cools, but not both. 4) Restrict edgier colors to closed-off rooms. Rooms that are out of the sightline of other spaces are a good place to go wild with color, if you're so inclined. Think Master bedrooms, kids rooms, powder rooms, etc. 5) Emphasize with accessories.

                    <p class="tile--description">Simply put, this is the amount of debt a buyer has compared to their yearly income. Buyers don't need to be debt-free to secure loans -- loan officers are accustomed to working with certain kinds of debt, like student loans. But, if this ratio is too high, it could be hard for them to secure a loan (or it might result in a higher interest rate).  </p>

                    <p class="tile--description">We know that interest rates are the lowest they've been in a while, but how does a lender calculate what an interest rate might look like for an individual buyer? Here are some factors they might consider when making that decision: Credit score -- if a buyer's credit score is higher, their interest rate will likely be lower. Down payment -- if a client puts less than 20% down on a property purchase, the lender might require mortgage insurance, which requires a slightly higher interest rate. Loan term -- in general, shorter-term loans have lower interest rates and lower overall costs, but higher monthly payments. Interest rate type -- fixed interest rates are locked in, but adjustable rates fluctuate based on the market after an initial period. This means clients might qualify for a lower rate early on, but the rate could gradually increase. This topic is an educational content minefield. Feel free to pick and choose different aspects to draw attention to, and to teach your clients' audiences how they could potentially qualify for lower interest rates. <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CPBqyUVhzUs/">Learn more &raquo;</a></p>

                    <p class="tile--description">Foreclosure is the process of a lender seizing and selling a property to a new buyer when the owner fails to make their mortgage payments as agreed. It enables the lender to recover at least some of the mortgage balance that is left. In some states, there must be a legal process in court before the home can be taken. Other states offer options that don't require a court to get involved. They also might be priced to sell quickly because of the lender’s need to recoup their losses. <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-a-foreclosure-1798185">Learn more &raquo;</a></p>

The buyer has probably researched the surrounding neighborhood and schools and viewed the home online, but they haven't taken an in-person tour of the property. We've seen an uptick in this since the coronavirus pandemic -- social distancing concerns and low home inventory have caused buyers to consider this method and act quickly. To reduce risk and improve the virtual buying experience, experts suggest getting prequalified, taking a virtual tour of the home, doing homework on the area and property, and shopping around for the best rates.  </p>
