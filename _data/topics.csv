Adjustable-rate mortgages,"Due to record-high home prices, more buyers than ever are choosing to go with adjustable-rate mortgages, which offer lower monthly payments initially. People are looking to save money on monthly payments by any means possible. However, the mortgage rate on these types of loans reset after a set amount of years -- usually five or ten. If rates go down by that time, that's a good thing for the buyer. However, if rates go up, their monthly payments will increase to reflect the market at that time. Since mortgage rates are historically low right now, making this choice could saddle buyers with higher payments in the future. It's a risk, but it's one that could pay off if the buyer intends to sell their home after the initial period elapses.

Getting spooky in the suburbs?,"Black-painted homes have long been trendy in urban areas, but now we're seeing this edgy trend start to pop up in suburbs across the country. Black houses do look stylish and can create some unique curb appeal -- they certainly stand out, especially in suburban areas. It's important to consider the type of architecture before taking this aesthetic step -- darker hues look great on houses with barn-like exteriors, but may look strange on more intricate homes. Black or dark hues can also play a supporting role in a color story instead of standing is as the main character. Black houses also may incur higher energy costs because they attract heat. In any case, this is an idea that people are sure to have opinions on.  Try posting a stock image of a beautiful black home, ask what people think, and let your audience sound off in the comments.

Traditionally, smaller homes with lower selling prices have served as the first rung on the homeownership ladder.

Cohesive colors,"Color palates are personal, and not everyone likes the same thing. Sellers shouldn't be afraid to express their tastes through paint and color, but here are some tips to avoid a choppy, dissonant experience for potential buyers: 1) Pick a flow-through paint. This means choose a consistent paint color for the walls of connecting spaces to create a cohesive feel. The foyer, hallway, and main connectors should ass be the same color. 2) Think about sightlines. This term refers to the walls in other rooms you may see while standing in one room. The colors on these different walls need to go together so they don't clash. 3) Choose color groups. A simple way to avoid clashing color schemes is to stick to the same color-temperature family -- warms or cools, but not both. 4) Restrict edgier colors to closed-off rooms. Rooms that are out of the sightline of other spaces are a good place to go wild with color, if you're so inclined. Think Master bedrooms, kids rooms, powder rooms, etc. 5) Emphasize with accessories. There are ways to inject bold colors that aren't the main focus of the room. That way, it's less jarring and easier to swap out for a different aesthetic at any time.

New home updates,"Home construction has continues to improve after the dip in the last quarter, but home builders are still being faced with challenges, including a lack of labor and building materials.

Unpacking tips,"Congrats! You've found a new home. Moving can be daunting, and unpacking -- even more so. Here are some tips for how to streamline the process: 1) Move room by room, and start with the essentials. Instead of unpacking a little here and there, it'll feel much better to have one room fully unpacked than a few that are partially done. Pack essentials like bedding, toiletries, and medications in ways that are easily accessible. 2) Keep purging as you unpack. Presumably, you got rid of unwanted or unnecessary items while you packed. However, while you're unpacking, be ruthless. Set aside a box to collect extraneous belongings for donation while you are in the unpacking process.  3) Use lists! It's likely that things will be arranged differently in your new home than your last one. Tape lists of their contents outside of each drawer or cabinet until you become familiarized with what's inside.
